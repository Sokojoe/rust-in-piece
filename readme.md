# Rust In Pieces


Rust-in-pieces is a text based roguelike game played in the terminal. I is developed using the rust programming language. 
The game takes place in a lawless wasteland where anything can happen. Collect equipment, supplies and ammunition and try to survive as long as you can!



### How to play?

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Sokojoe/rust-in-piece.git

$ cargo build --release

$ ./target/release/rust-in-piece(.exe if windows)

```



### Design Goals

* Permadeath 

* Easy to pickup and play, but hard to master.

* Keep interface easy to read and understand.

* Procedurally generated experience, different every time.

* Make exciting combat system for turn based game.

* No experience levels, power is based on equipment.
